# Curated-list-of-resources-for-GraphML-AI

Machine learning(ML) a sub-group of Artifical Intelligence(AI) is widely used in solving a wide range of real-world problems. They use various forms of data to address them of which graph data is one of them. Neo4j is one of the database used to store this graph data, also it is easy to analyse by establising relationship(edges) between the data often denoted as nodes.
