## Customizing neo4j

To visualize the meta-models using Graph database we can use neo4j. However, they need to be tailored for our use-cases.

The partially customized UI can be found in the github link [Custom_neo4j](https://github.com/Sruthi5797/neo4j-browser)

## GraphML

GraphML was another potential research topic. A literature survey is conducted on identifying research questions.
The resources can be found in the following links
